##basicGAN: literally a basic GAN

11/11/2020

*this small project is being developed using the tutorial at*
https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-interpolate-and-perform-vector-arithmetic-with-faces-using-a-generative-adversarial-network/

i am hoping to teach myself a little more about how to develop GANs from scratch,
as well as gain some proficiency in manipulating trained GAN latent spaces to create art.
